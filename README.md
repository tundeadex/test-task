I have implemented the task in Java in a maven project using [rest-assured](https://rest-assured.io/) as the main library

### PREREQUISITES

1. Java (I used openjdk 8)
2. Maven

### LIBRARIES USED

1. [rest-assured](https://rest-assured.io/)
2. [JUnit 5](https://junit.org/junit5/)
3. json-schema-validator (rest-assured)

### To Run test
clone the repository, ensure you have Java and maven installed and run the following command

`mvn clean test`

### ANSWERS TO QUESTION

#### 1 How long did the task take?
I spent a little over 4hours. 
Things I would have done if I spent a bit more time include

1. Created different classes to map Method Names and Request Parameters
2. Add a reporting tool 
3. Covered more test cases especially the unhappy paths

#### 2 What do you think is the most interesting trend in test automation?
Visual Regression

#### 3 What is contract testing?
Contract Testing
